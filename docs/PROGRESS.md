# Progress

_Last updated: 2026-09-30 (step 4b)._

## Current step

**Step 4b: Python image pipeline, Alembic migrations as a Helm hook, schema
and grants.** Done.

Next: **step 4c**: database privilege checks in `make verify-boundary`.

## Follow-ups

- Review the *Options / Why / Trade-off* write-ups drafted in
  [`DECISIONS.md`](DECISIONS.md).
- Step 4c, privilege checks, each over the network (never via `127.0.0.1`,
  which the official image trusts without a password, D14) and inside a
  rolled-back transaction:
  - `ingestor` can read `subscriptions` and insert into `posts`, but cannot
    read `summaries`, write `post_sentiments` or create tables;
  - `analysis` can read `posts` and write `summaries`, but cannot insert
    into `posts` or create tables.

  Also check what the application steps will rely on:
  - `analysis` can insert into `subscriptions` (identity column) with
    INSERT alone;
  - `ingestor` can run `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` with INSERT alone;
  - deleting a subscription as `analysis` cascades to `subscription_posts`
    and `summaries`.
- Steps 5 and 9: pods must carry `app.kubernetes.io/component`, and Services
  must also select `app.kubernetes.io/instance`, so that the
  `verify-boundary` test pods never receive traffic (D12).
- Step 6: decide how hashtag credentials are provided (A6).
- Step 7: `k3d image import` copies each image into all 3 nodes, and imports
  are slow on this HDD. Measure it with the multi-GB LLM image and consider
  importing it only where the LLM runs. Add the LLM checks to
  `verify-boundary`: the worker reaches it, the API does not.
- Step 8: decide the tie-break rule for the dominant label (A3).
- Step 10: the `local-path` volume pins PostgreSQL to one node. For the
  drain demo, drain a node that does *not* host `postgres-0`, or explain the
  outage (D14).

## How to resume

- Work inside WSL2 (Ubuntu 24.04); the repository is at `~/social-signal`. Docker
  Engine runs inside WSL, not Docker Desktop.
- WSL shuts the distribution down when it is idle (about 15 s with no WSL
  processes), which stops Docker and the k3d cluster. `make start` brings the
  cluster back (about 2 minutes). To avoid it, set `instanceIdleTimeout=-1`
  under `[general]` in `%UserProfile%\.wslconfig`.
- kubectl: `kubectl --context k3d-socialsignal ...`. On this machine the
  context is already the current one, because the kubeconfig had none
  before (D8).
- From Windows PowerShell 5.1, embedded double quotes break
  `wsl -e bash -lc "..."`; use Git Bash with `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1` instead.
- `uv sync --all-packages` recreates the development virtualenv.
